1. Project Overview
An AI-controlled player moves left and right to avoid falling obstacles. It starts with random movements but learns over time using reinforcement learning (Q-learning or a simple rule-based approach).

2. Tech Stack
Python (for coding)
Pygame (for visualization)
Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning or heuristic-based AI)


3. Step-by-Step Plan

Step 1: Set Up the Game Environment
Create a Pygame window (e.g., 500x500 pixels).
Add a player (square or circle) at the bottom of the screen.
Generate falling objects that randomly drop from the top.


Step 2: Implement Player Movement
Allow the player to move left and right within screen boundaries.
Initially, the AI will move randomly.

Step 3: Collision Detection
If a falling object hits the player, the game ends (or the player loses a life).
If the player dodges successfully, it gains a reward.


Step 4: Add Basic AI (Random Movements)
AI makes random moves (left, right, or stay still).
Run a loop where AI repeatedly plays the game.

Step 5: Implement Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
AI gets rewards for survival (e.g., +1 for every second survived).
AI gets punishment for getting hit (e.g., -10 for collision).
AI learns over time to make better movements.

Step 6: Improve AI Performance
Train the AI for multiple runs (e.g., 10,000 games).
Introduce exploration vs. exploitation (balance between trying new moves and using learned strategies).

Step 7: Visualize Learning Progress
Show real-time AI behavior in Pygame.
Print AI scores to track progress.

4. Possible Expansions (Future Features)
✅ Speed increase (objects fall faster over time).
✅ Different difficulty levels (more obstacles, smaller player).
✅ Power-ups (like temporary shields or slow-motion effects).
✅ Genetic Algorithm-based AI (instead of Q-learning).
